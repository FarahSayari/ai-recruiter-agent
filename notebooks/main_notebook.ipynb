    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to develop an **AI Recruiter Agent** capable of:\n",
    "- Automatically reading and analyzing unstructured CVs.  \n",
    "- Matching candidates intelligently to job descriptions using semantic similarity.  \n",
    "- Ranking candidates based on relevance.  \n",
    "- Providing human-like explanations for each match.  \n",
    "- Reducing the manual screening time for HR professionals.  \n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Dataset Overview**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use a Kaggle dataset containing the following key columns:  \n",
    "`ID`, `Name`, `Role`, `Transcript`, `Resume`, `Decision`, `Reason_for_decision`, `Job_Description`  \n",
    "\n",
    "For this notebook, we focus mainly on **textual columns**:  \n",
    "`Resume`, `Transcript`, and `Job_Description`, which represent the candidate’s background and the job requirements.\n",

    "| **3. Data Preparation** | (Already completed) Preprocess CVs and job descriptions. |\n",
    "| **4. Modeling** | Convert text into embeddings using BERT, store vectors in Qdrant, and perform similarity-based matching. |\n",

    "This notebook focuses on **Modeling**, **Evaluation**, and **Deployment preparation**.  \n",
    "Specifically, it will:  \n",
    "1. Generate **embeddings** for CVs and job descriptions using **Sentence-BERT**.  \n",
    "2. Store embeddings and metadata in a **Qdrant vector database**.  \n",
    "3. Implement **retrieval logic** (RAG) to find the best candidates for a job.  \n",
    "4. Generate **explanations** for candidate-job matches using **Phi-3 (Ollama)**.  \n",
    "5. Prepare nodes and workflow for final **LangGraph agent integration**.\n"

    "- Converted text to lowercase to ensure consistency.\n",

    "- Tokenized text into words.\n",

    "- Calculated word counts before and after cleaning for comparison.\n",

    "### Objective  \n",
    "Transform textual data (CVs and Job Descriptions) into **numerical vector representations** that capture semantic meaning.  \n",
    "These embeddings will later be stored in **Qdrant**, allowing our system to perform **similarity-based retrieval** between job requirements and candidate profiles.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How It Works  \n",
    "- Uses **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** a deep contextual model trained to understand language semantics.  \n",
    "- Each text (CV or job description) is tokenized, passed through BERT, and converted into a **768-dimensional embedding vector**.  \n",
    "- The **mean pooling** of token embeddings represents the global meaning of the text.  \n",
    "- These embeddings are the foundation of the **matching and ranking logic** in the next stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### In This Notebook  \n",
    "We call the function `generate_embeddings()` from `embeddings.py` to process two main columns:  \n",
    "- `Resume_clean` → Candidate information.  \n",
    "- `Job_Description_clean` → Job requirements.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The output (`bert_embeddings`) will contain two matrices of shape `(num_texts × 768)` representing both sides of our recruitment problem.\n"
